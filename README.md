# !!NOTE!!
This project is nowhere near complete just yet! There are still many things I'm exploring, learning, and experimenting with! Thus, do not be surprised when you enter the Google Sheets and see basically nothing...

# What is Bus Timing Tracker?
It's a personal project to track the bus timings between my home and workplace. I did this as a personal proof that the bus timings were inconsistent. However, I also aim to use this project to make sense of the bus timings and leave my house a calculated time before it is expected to reach. 

# Benefit to you
## Understanding my portfolio
I believe that this little project can show my ability in using Google AppScript to serve a function and purpose. I also believe that the project when viewed in tandem with newer more updated projects will reflect my approach to learning/doing programming.

## Learning Code
I'm pretty sure that this piece of code is terribly written. However, I believe that you can gain some insights into it such as:
- Basic syntax and usage of AppScript in the application to Google Sheets
- A little case study into how I particularly wrote this piece of code.
